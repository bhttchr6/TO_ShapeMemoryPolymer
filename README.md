Finite Element Analysis and Topology Optimization for compliant gripper design with thermally-activated Shape Memory Polymers (SMP). It has following features:
  1. Implemented thermo-visco-inelastic constitutive model for SMP.
  2. SMP is bi-phasic with each phase modelled viscoelastically
  3. Transient adjoint sensitivity analysis
  4. High Performance Computing (PETSc, Eigen, C++, MPI)
